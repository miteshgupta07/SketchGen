# SketchGen: Transform Your Imagination into Images✨

**SketchGen** is an innovative tool that allows users to generate realistic images from text descriptions or sketches. Powered by the **Stable Diffusion 3.5 model**, it combines cutting-edge AI with creative freedom to produce stunning visuals from user inputs.

## Features 🚀

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Enter a text prompt and let the AI create images based on your imagination. 📝➡️🖼️
- **Sketch-to-Image Generation**: (Coming soon...) Convert your rough sketches into realistic images. ✏️➡️🖼️
- **Customization Options**:
  - **Style Selection**: Choose from **Default**, **Photorealistic**, or **Anime** styles. 🎨
  - **Image Resolution**: Select from **512x512**, **768x768**, or **1024x1024** resolution. 🖥️
  - **Fine-tune with** **Inference Steps** and **Guidance Scale** for better control over the generated image. ⚙️

## Demo 💻

You can try out the application on [Streamlit](https://sketchgen.streamlit.app/).
