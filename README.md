# SketchGen
SketchGen is an Image-to-Image Translation project that generates realistic images from hand-drawn sketches and descriptive prompts. Built using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, it combines the structure of sketches with the creativity of textual guidance to create stunning visuals.
